# DeepLearning
1.DL projects for some competitions(such as,ImageNet,Kaggle,AI challenger...)  
2.make some notes about ML,DL  
3.Try to use diffrent frames (tensorflow，mxnet，pytorch)  

## notes:
> 
1.Write clearly what framework is used in every project and in the end,add your name(such as,gloun_cifar10_peter)  
2.Do not need to put your data in this repo,just show link(it can be origin links or your private link for your project)  
3.for making sure your project can run in every mechine,it is beter to write requirement.txt to tell others some requirements   


#######
I hope every guy can share your project and notes about DL, and then all of us can quickly learn more about DL...  
In the end,enjot it !!!

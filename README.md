# DeepLearning

1.DL projects for some competitions\(such as,ImageNet,Kaggle,AI challenger...\)  
2.Make some notes about ML,DL  
3.Try to use diffrent frames \(tensorflow，mxnet，pytorch\)  
4. Add note to record some interview skills

## notes:

> 1.Write clearly what framework is used in every project and in the end,add your name\(such as,gloun\_cifar10\_peter\)  
> 2.Do not need to put your data in this repo,just show link\(it can be origin links or your private link for your project\)  
> 3.For making sure your project can run in every mechine,it is beter to write requirement.txt to tell others some requirements

##### 

I hope every guy can share your project and notes about DL, and then all of us can quickly learn more about DL...  
In the end,enjot it !!!
